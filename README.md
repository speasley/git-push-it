# Git Push It

## Oooh, baby, baby

Spice up your Git pushes with a little little six-note tribute to Salt-N-Pepa. Now push it good.

## Git up on this

1. Make the installation script executable: `chmod +x install.sh`.
1. Now run install.sh and you're real good.

## Git on out of this

1. Make the uninstallation script executable: `chmod +x uninstall.sh`.
1. Now run uninstall.sh and you're less spicy again.
