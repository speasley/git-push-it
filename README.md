# Git Push It

## Oooh, baby, baby

Spice up your Git pushes with a little little six-note tribute to Salt-N-Pepa. Now push it good.

## Git up on this

1. Open your shell's profile file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile for Bash, or ~/.zshrc for Zsh) in a text editor.
1. Copy and paste the contents of git-push-it.sh into your profile file.
1. Replace "/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3" with the actual path to your audio file.
1. Save the file and reload your shell configuration (e.g., by running source ~/.bashrc).
